This is the RoS workspace for the simulations. In order to run this, please perform the following:

Place this folder in the src folder of your catkin workspace.

Run "catkin build ros_ws" to build the workspace.

Source the setup.bash or setup.zsh file in the /devel folder of your catkin workspace.

Use "source ~/Path-to-catkin-workspace/devel/setup.bash" to do this.


After this, give read, write and execute permissions to the python script in the "scripts" folder as:

"chmod 777 TurtlebotAstart_simulation.py"

!!DO NOT FORGET TO PERFORM THIS STEP!!


Both video 1 and video 2 require different input parameters. Unfortunately, these cannot be passed to the python script via the launch file due to the limitations of RoS.

Hence, we make use of environment variables to pass these parameters from the launch file.

In order to do this, we need to edit the launch file as follows:

	For video 1, Choose option 1 in the launch file, and uncomment the corressponding lines.

	For video 2, uncomment the other set of lines.

After this is done, run the launch file in the workspace as follows:

"roslaunch simulation.launch"

This should open up gazebo with the turtlebot in the initial position, and after a while a graph should come up.

CLOSE THIS GRAPH TO START THE SIMULATION!
